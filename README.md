Initialization:
insert the initdbpt2.sql into the ABSTravellings db you should have. :)
<hr>
For each transaction, there should be a corresponding servlet [Java Resources-> src -> servlet]
and a corresponding JSP [WebContent->WEBINF->Views]
The included transactions only work on "pt2" of the db which is all just testing data. Use this to see how transactions are implemented and use these as a basis for implementing tranactions to ABSTravellings.
